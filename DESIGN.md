Design is probably the wrong word. The goal of this document is to, uh,
DOCUMENT the steps I plan to take to get this program up and running.
This is expected to be a living document subject to frequent
modification (and delusional goals).

Next steps:

<ol>
    <li>Create a small part of the first level (physics not priority)</li>
    <li>Write basic player movement (animation optional, not priority)</li>
    <li>Write basic enemy AI (animation optional)</li>
    <li>Pit the player against the basic enemy AI</li>
</ol>
