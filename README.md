<h1>keen5-linux</h1>

My C++ remake of Commander Keen 5 for Linux.

I have <a href="https://github.com/PlanetLotus/keen5">another repository</a> for the same project. The old one is designed for Windows and is using SDL 1.2. Since it's way more convenient to write code in a Linux-based environment, I've decided to start over with Linux in mind (hopefully I can make it cross-platform anyway!) and also start using SDL 2.0 instead of 1.2.

<h2>Program Motivation</h2>

I started writing this program because I wanted more experience using C++, OOP,
and graphics libraries. I chose to create a remake of Commander Keen 5
because it's one of my favorite games and I've been playing it since I was
very young.
